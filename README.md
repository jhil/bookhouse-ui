Bookhouse UI
========================================

## Setup

Install [npm][npm-install]. Then, install gulp:

```
npm install -g gulp  # May require `sudo`
```

## Developing

```
npm install
gem install scss_lint
gulp serve
```

## Gulp Commands

An overview of Gulp commands available:

### `gulp build`

Builds the site into the `dist` directory.  This includes:

- SCSS w/ linting, sourcemaps and autoprefixing
- JS linting, uglification, and ES6 to ES5 conversion
- Handlebars to HTML

### `gulp build:optimized`

This is used for distributing an optimized version of the site (for deployment).  It includes everything from `gulp build` as well as:
- SCSS minification
- CSS / JS inline-sourcing 

### `gulp watch`

Watchs for changes in local files and rebuilds parts of the site as necessary, into the `dist` directory.

### `gulp serve`

Runs `gulp watch` in the background, and serves the `dist` directory at `localhost:3000` with automatic reloading using [Browsersync][browsersync].

### `gulp deploy`

For use by the Minimill team only.  Deploys to `work.minimill.co/TITLE/`, but won't do so without proper authentication.
